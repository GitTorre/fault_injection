Previous work on fault injection such as the Netflix Simian Army\cite{netflix:chaosmonkey} provides a set of tools for inducing faults such as randomly crashing processes have been released on their webservice running on Amazon's cloud. The downside to randomly crashing nodes is the cost of restarting the nodes again, which RLFI avoids. Orchestra\cite{orchestra}, a fault injection environment developed by Scott Dawson et al. requires changes to the raw socket API, which might seem appealing to those who prefer application level instrumentation. Ferrari\cite{ferrari} is similar to how RLFI current introduce faults in that it relies on software traps that are triggered by events such as memory access to actually inject the faults.

Magpie\cite{magpie} is a modeling service that collects request-level traces across a distributed system, but requires that applications follow a specific schema. X-trace\cite{xtrace} also provides fine-grained traces through an annotation propagation scheme, but the performance is greatly impacted because of the abundace in metadata recorded. Zipkin\cite{zipkin} requires application level implementation of the client and server, and contains components that are not useful for our aim. Dapper\cite{sigelman:dapper} greatly resembles the Opentracing architecture, but it is internally deployed at Google.
